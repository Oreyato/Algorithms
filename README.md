# Algorithms

Currently, there is an issue

Issue: the algorithm shows the worst path **when going from A to F, work otherwise*

Reason: it doesn't stop at the right moment and continues through the whole process, leading us to the very last possibility, very often the worse one

Solution: after the while loop, adding a way to know which connection was the best [close list?]
